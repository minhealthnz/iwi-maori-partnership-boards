# Iwi Māori Partnership Boards

This repository holds the concordance files for Iwi-Māori Partnership Boards (IMPB) to Stats NZ meshblock 2013 (`impb_mb13.xlsx`), meshblock 2018 (`impb_mb18.xlsx`)and Domicile 2013 (`impb_dom13.xlsx`). These files aim to provide a geographic approximation of Iwi-Māori Partnership Board areas for creating health statisitics for IMPBs. 

A seperate geometry file is also provided to enable geospatial presentation of IMPB boundaries (`impb_geometry.geojson`). This file is zipped due to size restraints.

The boundaries shown in these files are superseded by the written definitions of the Iwi-Māori Partnership Board boundaries included in the [Pae Ora (Healthy Futures) Act 2022, Schedule 4](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2022/0030/latest/LMS575405.html).
